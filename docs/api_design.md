# API Design

- For naming rule, prefer Processing function names and calling convention (this would match V and gg.)
- For implementation, prioritize openFramworks compatibility, especially when Processing has different theory (for example `fill` / `no_fill`.)
- If function overload or global variables becomes problem, check how Ebitengine or gg is doing, and choose natural one.
